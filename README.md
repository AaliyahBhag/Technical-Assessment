# Technical-Assessment

This code presents a user interface for pricing South African Government Bonds (SAGBs), offering the option to use example inputs or input custom values. It calculates the clean price, accrued interest, and all-in-price of the bond based on the provided data.

**Instructions:**

**NB: Please make sure the Main Class and Bond Class are in two seperate tabs in your IDE.**  
It begins by welcoming the user and asking if they want to use example inputs (1 or 2) or input their own values. Example one and two are the examples provided in the assessment  
If the user chooses example 1 or 2, predefined values for settlement date, maturity date, last coupon date, coupon rate, yield, and face value are used.  
If the user chooses "no", they are prompted to input their own values for these parameters.  
The bond object is created using the provided or predefined values.  
The clean price, accrued interest, and dirty price are calculated using the methods defined in the Bond class.  
The results are printed to the console. 

**Efficiency Mechanisms**  
Caching Mechanism: To avoid redundant calculations, the system caches the present value of face value and coupons. This caching mechanism improves performance by eliminating unnecessary recalculations.

Optimized Coupon Date Generation: The system generates coupon dates only up to the maturity date of the bond. This optimization reduces unnecessary iterations and improves the efficiency of the coupon date generation process.

Lazy Evaluation of Present Values: The system evaluates the present values of face value and coupons only when required. This lazy evaluation strategy minimizes computation overhead and enhances performance.

**Solution Approach**  
Object-Oriented Design: The solution employs an object-oriented design approach to model bonds as objects with properties and behaviors. This design promotes modularity, extensibility, and code reuse.

Separation of Concerns: The solution separates the bond pricing logic into distinct methods within the Bond class. This separation of concerns enhances code readability, maintainability, and testability.

Exception Handling: The solution handles exceptional cases, such as negative input values and invalid bond parameters, using Java exceptions. This approach ensures robustness and reliability in handling erroneous input.

**Data Structure**  
LocalDate: The LocalDate class from the java.time package is used to represent dates in the bond pricing system. This data structure provides convenient methods for date manipulation and comparison.

List: The List interface from the java.util package is used to store coupon dates generated by the system. This dynamic data structure allows flexible manipulation of coupon dates during the bond pricing process.

Double: The double primitive data type is used to represent numerical values, such as coupon rate, yield, face value, and present values. This data type offers efficient storage and arithmetic operations for floating-point numbers.
