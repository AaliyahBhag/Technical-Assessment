# Technical-Assessment

This code presents a user interface for pricing South African Government Bonds (SAGBs), offering the option to use example inputs or input custom values. It calculates the clean price, accrued interest, and all-in-price of the bond based on the provided data.

Instructions:

NB: Please make sure the Main Class and Bond Class are in two seperate tabs in your IDE.  
It begins by welcoming the user and asking if they want to use example inputs (1 or 2) or input their own values. Example one and two are the examples provided in the assessment  
If the user chooses example 1 or 2, predefined values for settlement date, maturity date, last coupon date, coupon rate, yield, and face value are used.  
If the user chooses "no", they are prompted to input their own values for these parameters.  
The bond object is created using the provided or predefined values.  
The clean price, accrued interest, and dirty price are calculated using the methods defined in the Bond class.  
The results are printed to the console.
